# NeoVim Dot Files
The configs have been rewritten from scratch to suit my personal workflow.

for the key bindings check the keymap file.


## Ideas
- Is there a todo plugin that collect all the todos from the code comments
and make the available in a quicklist to cycle throught and fix.

- Add better completion support
- Add Sql/Db support
